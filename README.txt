# sem_dit009_assignment2
In our 2nd assignment of fundamentals of programming, we use the Spotify API, Wikimedia API and lyrics API to analyze artists and their music.

For filepaths to work, it is Required to have the folder group_27_assignment_2 open (e.g. in VSCode) so that it is the default root.

Run the music_data_analyser.py file with the before mentioned folder as root directory to run the program. Have fun!
